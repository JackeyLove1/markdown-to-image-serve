To deploy with Docker Compose:

```

## Platform-Specific Notes

For different architectures:

1. x86 architectures (Linux, Windows, Mac Intel): Set platform to linux/x86 in docker-compose.yml
2. Apple Silicon: Set platform to linux/amd64 in docker-compose.yml

## Manual Deployment

To deploy manually:

1. Build the application:

npm run build
```

2. Start the production server:
